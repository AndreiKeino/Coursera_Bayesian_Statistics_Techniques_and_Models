00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.540
There are several software packages
available that will handle the details

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.950
of MCMC for us.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.440
We've provided a supplementary document
to this lesson which gives an outline,

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
a brief outline of the different
options available to you.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.260
The package we will use
in this course is JAGS.

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.750
Which stands for Just Another Gibbs
Sampler written by Martyn Plummer.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.390
The program is free and
it runs on Mac OS, Windows and Linux.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.020
Better yet, the program can be run using
R from the RJAGS or R2JAGS packages.

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.170
In JAGS, we can specify models and

10
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.200
run MCMC samplers with
just a few lines of code.

11
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.540
JAGS does the rest for us so we can focus
more on the statistical modeling aspect,

12
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.280
and less on the implementation.

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.830
It makes powerful basin
machinery available to us.

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.470
So, we consider] wide variety of
statistical models relatively easily.

15
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.988
The starting place for
JAGS users is this website,

16
00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:19.850
mcmc.jags.sourceforge.net.

17
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.661
At this site, you can find news about the
features of the latest release of JAGS,

18
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:31.310
links to program documentation,
as well as instructions for installation.

19
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.400
The documentation for
JAGS is particularly important to us.

20
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.780
It is available under
the files page right here.

21
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.867
We'll open that up under
the manuals folder.

22
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.337
We're going to use
the latest version of JAGS,

23
00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:58.390
we'll look at four here, and
we'll download the Jags user manual.

24
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.204
We've already downloaded it, so
let's take a look at the JAGS user manual.

25
00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.262
The user manual has a lot of useful
information including how to run models

26
00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:20.748
Different modules available,
the functions available to us in

27
00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:25.670
the JAGS language as well as
probability distributions.

28
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.230
Chapters 5 and 6 will be especially
important to us, as we model.

29
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.440
Let's take a look at chapter
6 in distributions, page 29.

30
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.220
This chapter documents
all of the statistical

31
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.070
probability distributions
that we can use in JAGS.

32
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.550
We will refer back to this often, because
it shows us the functions that correspond

33
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.290
with the different distributions and
how they're parameterized.

34
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.330
For example, notice that in jags,

35
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.900
the normal distribution is parameterized
differently than in it is in R.

36
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.082
We need to keep that in
mind while we're modeling.

37
00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:13.575
Let's go back to the web page.

38
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.370
And start from the beginning again.

39
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.640
Under the files page, again down here.

40
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.810
We'll find the JAGS folder.

41
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.660
This is where we can download and

42
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.430
install the latest version of JAGS,
in this case, four.

43
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.260
From here,
you can select your operating system and

44
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.650
follow the directions to download and
install JAGS.

45
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.430
Once JAGS is installed, we can immediately
run it from R using the R JAGS package.

46
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.790
The next segment we'll
show how this is done
