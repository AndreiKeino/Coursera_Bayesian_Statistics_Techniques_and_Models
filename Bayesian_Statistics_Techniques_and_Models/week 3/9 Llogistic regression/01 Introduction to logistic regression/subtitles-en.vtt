2
00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:08.854
Linear regression is used when we
have a continuous response variable,

3
00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:12.890
and several explanatory variables,
or co-variance.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.710
But what if the response
variable is binary, zero or one?

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.510
We could still fit
a linear regression model.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.200
That might look something like this.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.210
Here I've written the x axis for
the explanatory variable.

8
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.370
And the response variable is here y,
on the y axis.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.680
It can only take values of 0 and 1.

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380
So if we were to draw a linear
regression through these

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.780
points it might look something like that.

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.510
As you can see,

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.390
only two very specific values of x
will cause a prediction of 0 or 1.

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.100
Not to mention, if we were to draw
a residual plot from this regression

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.839
right here, it would certainly not
appear to be very normally distributed.

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.020
Instead of using a normal likelihood,

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.410
it is more appropriate to use
a Bernoulli likelihood here.

18
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.871
That is, the response yi, given phi

19
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:18.510
i would be independent from
a Bernoulli distribution.

20
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.449
Phi i, where phi i is the probability
of success for observation i.

21
00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:34.560
In this case,
phi i is also the expected value of yi.

22
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.340
But we still need to relate this phi
i to our explanatory variable x.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510
Remember, in linear regression,

24
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.574
We had the expected value
of yi was equal to,

25
00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:58.714
directly to the linear form in the x's.

26
00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.790
Like this.

27
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.400
One option in this model, would be to
model phi directly with this linear form.

28
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.258
But there's one problem,
because phi represents a probability,

29
00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:21.010
it needs to lie between 0 and 1.

30
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.271
To keep this linear form
right here between 0 and 1,

31
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:29.060
we would need to place some pretty odd
restrictions on the beta coefficients.

32
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.410
Instead, we'll use what
is called a link function

33
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.575
that relates the linear form of
the restricted parameter, in our case phi.

34
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.410
Without any restrictions on the beta's.

35
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.970
To do this, we could use the odds which
is defined as phi over 1 minus phi.

36
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.312
Odds can take on any value greater than 0.

37
00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:58.790
So, we're less restricted but,
not totally unrestricted.

38
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.970
So now let's take the log of the odds.

39
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:11.210
This quantity is called the logit link,
or logistic link.

40
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.630
It can now take on any real number,
positive or negative, so

41
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.668
it can be related to our linear
form without any restrictions.

42
00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:23.310
That is, the logit of phi i,

43
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.306
which is equal to the log of the odds,

44
00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:35.697
will be equal to this linear form here.

45
00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:44.290
So this is the piece that relates
the x to the success probability.

46
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.660
If we do a little bit of algebra,
we can recover the expression for

47
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.710
the expected value of yi.

48
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.080
That is, from this we can get
the expected value of yi, which is phi.

49
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.250
So we just need to solve
this equation here for phi,

50
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.550
which will be the e to
the beta not plus beta

51
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.610
1 x1i, over 1 plus the same thing.

52
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.498
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by the numerator,

53
00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:27.740
we get this form.

54
00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:39.530
This form is a little bit more
computationally convenient.

55
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.260
This process right here is called
inverting the link function

56
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.000
to get an expression for
the expected value of y.

57
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.080
Now, if we were to plot expected value
of y as a function of x, over here.

58
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.670
It might look something like this.

59
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.310
Where the expected value
now stays between 0 and 1.

60
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.740
This is logistic regression
using the logistic link.

61
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.674
If the beta coefficient for
x, for the covariant x,

62
00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:23.746
is positive, it means that
an increase in the value of x

63
00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:29.286
corresponds to an increase in
the probability that y is 1.

64
00:05:29.286 --> 00:05:31.160
So the curve would look like this.

65
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.800
If the coefficient is negative, that is,

66
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.630
beta is negative, that means that
an increase in x would correspond to

67
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.030
a decrease in the probability
that y is equal to 1.

68
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.940
So it's just a negative
version of that dotted curve.

69
00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:54.439
There are other possible link functions,
but we're just going to focus on this one.

70
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.000
Of course we can add more x variables
like we did with multiple regression.

71
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.429
And some, or all of those x variables,
could be categorical,

72
00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:05.736
like we had with ANOVA.

73
00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:12.099
