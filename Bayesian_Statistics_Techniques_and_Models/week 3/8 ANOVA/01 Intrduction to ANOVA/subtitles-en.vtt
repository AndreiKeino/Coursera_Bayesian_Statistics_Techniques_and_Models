2
00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:08.297
Anova is used when we have
categorical explanatory variables so

3
00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.450
that the observations belong to groups.

4
00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:17.510
It's stand for, analysis of variance,
where we compare the variability of

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.740
responses within groups to the variability
of responses between groups.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.260
If the variability between groups is
large, relative to the variability

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.210
within the groups, we conclude
that there is a grouping effect.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.776
Categorical explanatory variables
are often referred to as factor variables.

9
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.880
Factors can have two categories or levels.

10
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.970
For example, low and
high or true and false.

11
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.220
Or they can have many levels.

12
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.130
They often result from experiments
where we carefully assign values of

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.050
explanatory variables.

14
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.740
Two randomly selected subjects, and
look for a cause and effect relationship.

15
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.670
There could be one, or
many factors in an experiment.

16
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.790
For example, if we are going to conduct
an online marketing experiment,

17
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.530
we might experiment with two
factors of website design.

18
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.293
Let's say these factors are sound.

19
00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:26.092
And font size.

20
00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:35.889
We might use two levels with sound.

21
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.960
For example, having music or
having no music.

22
00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:50.741
And for the font size factor, we might do

23
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:56.220
something like small, medium, and large.

24
00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:05.450
This two by three design would result in
a total of six treatment combinations.

25
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.580
For example, we could do a website with
music in small font, or no music in large.

26
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.210
There are six possible ways to do that.

27
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.693
Let's write down the model with one
explanatory variable that has g,

28
00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.341
capital g levels.

29
00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:29.564
That would be yi given
a variable that tells us

30
00:02:29.564 --> 00:02:33.655
which group individual I belongs to.

31
00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.966
All of the means for
each group and sigma squared would

32
00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:48.176
be independently distributed
normal where the mean is mu,

33
00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:53.410
the mu that corresponds to
the group of subject i.

34
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.133
And, of course, variance sigma squared.

35
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:05.829
This g variable right here is just
a group indicator, so it would be

36
00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.560
a member of one of this set, one of these
numbers right here, from 1 up to g.

37
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.800
So for individual i of gi is 2,
that means that yi is a member of group 2.

38
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.427
And, of course,
we have our observations 1 up to n.

39
00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:34.043
Alternatively, we can write the mean
in terms of an intercept representing

40
00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:39.670
a baseline group and then affects for
each of the g minus 1 other groups.

41
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.649
So we could write an alternative model,

42
00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:51.973
Alternative model formulation

43
00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:57.676
would be to set the expected value,

44
00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:02.429
right here, (yi) = beta0

45
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:07.561
+ beta1 X1i like we had before

46
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:12.135
up to betaG-1*XG-1i.

47
00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:21.078
Here the X variables are what
are called dummy variables.

48
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:26.310
They're indicators that

49
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.910
the group of individual I,
in this case, is 1.

50
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.100
This X here would be an indicator
variable that the group

51
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.690
of individual i is G minus 1.

52
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.320
That is at most one of the Xs will
be turned on or have a value of 1.

53
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.400
Otherwise, if we're in group capital G,
the last group, the only

54
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.790
parameter active is this one here, so beta
naught corresponds to the mean of group g.

55
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:06.770
Again, these Xs here are what
are called dummy variables,

56
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.310
they indicate the membership of
the observation into group k.

57
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.930
This formulation right here shows how
Anova is related to linear regression.

58
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.780
This formulation is also the default in r.

59
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.010
These two formulations for
the mean are equivalent and

60
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.180
both of them have capital G parameters for
the mean.

61
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.969
If we have more than capital G parameters,

62
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.760
the parameters would no
longer be uniquely identified

63
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.200
since infinite combinations of parameter
values would result in the same mean.

64
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.100
We must be careful not
to overparameterize.

65
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.110
Again, the assumption of constant
variance across all groups might be

66
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.420
too restrictive for your data.

67
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.759
If that's the case, you might also
consider having multiple sigma squared

68
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.804
parameters for different groups.

69
00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.990
We're now going to consider
the model where we have two factors.

70
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.580
Let's call the factors A and B.

71
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.940
They might correspond to sound being A,
and font size being B,

72
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.310
from our website design experiment
that we discussed earlier.

73
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.170
One option for a model is that now against
to the first model we used for one factor.

74
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.470
Where we have a different mean for
each stream and combination.

75
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.860
This is called the cell means model.

76
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.265
So if we have factor A which in this case
will be sound we have two levels, and

77
00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:54.070
for factor B which could be represented
by font size would have three levels.

78
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.280
So this might be representing small,
medium, and large.

79
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.570
In this model formulation,
we need a different mean for

80
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.231
each one of these combinations,
so Mu 1 sub 1 would

81
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:14.420
represent the mean for
this group with music and small font size.

82
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.461
We can fill in the rest of these.

83
00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.645
So each of these means
corresponds to a treatment group.

84
00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:37.540
It is written, the model itself
is written, the same as before,

85
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.180
except that Mu now has two indexes,
one for each factor.

86
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:49.860
With six treatment groups, we can have at
most six parameters describing the means.

87
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.570
However, we might get away
with fewer parameters.

88
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.959
For example,
we can use the following additive model.

89
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.995
This model,
which has only 4 parameter instead of 6,

90
00:08:08.995 --> 00:08:14.180
would be appropriate if we believe
there are no interactions.

91
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.000
Let's write this model out really quick.

92
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.080
The expected value for
yi would be equal to a baseline,

93
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:30.080
mean plus we'll say,
alpha-2 times the indicator.

94
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.479
That the level of factor A,

95
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:39.690
which we'll call little a for
individual I, is 2.

96
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.180
In other words, this is an indicator that
individual I is in level 2 of factor A.

97
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.390
Then we could have a beta
2 times an indicator.

98
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.676
That the level for individual

99
00:08:56.676 --> 00:09:01.751
I of factor B is equal to 2 plus

100
00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:08.665
beta 3 times an indicator that BI = 3.

101
00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.970
This Mu here represents the mean for
this group right here.

102
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:23.310
And then, if they are in different group,
for example, a factor A, we would

103
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:29.019
add alpha-2 which represents the effect
of going from this group to this group.

104
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.010
Same thing goes for factor B.

105
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.870
If we want to move from level
one of factor B up to level 2,

106
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.800
we would add this coefficient here.

107
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.630
It's an adjustment to the mean.

108
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.970
I mentioned earlier that this additive
model would be appropriate if we had no

109
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.760
interaction between the variables.

110
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.750
Or in other words, if we believe that
going from level 1 to level 2 of factor A,

111
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.310
has the same effect on the mean
regardless of whether we're in level 1,

112
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.620
2, or 3 of factor B.

113
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:15.920
If the effect of factor A on the response
changes between levels of factor B.

114
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.220
Then we would need more parameters
to describe how that mean changes.

115
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.440
For example, with this cell means model.

116
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.890
This phenomenon is called
interaction between the factors.

117
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.147
In the coming segments we will look at
an example of a one way Anova model.

118
00:10:35.147 --> 00:10:38.629
We'll work with the two-way
Anova in the honors section.

119
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:43.572
