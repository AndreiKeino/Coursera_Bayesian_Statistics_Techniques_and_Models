2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:07.011
Before we learn how to simulate from
complicated posterior distributions.

3
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:10.765
Let's review some of the basics
of Monte Carlo estimation.

4
00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:15.439
Monte Carlo estimation refers
to simulating hypothetical

5
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.716
draws from a probability distribution.

6
00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:23.350
In order to calculate important
quantities of that distribution.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.500
Some of these quantities might
include the mean, the variance,

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.710
the probability of some event, or
the quantiles of the distribution.

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.940
All of these calculations
involve integration.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.300
Which, except in the simplest cases,
can be very difficult or

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.530
even impossible to compute analytically.

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.155
Let's suppose we have
a random variable theta.

13
00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:50.952
This random variable theta
is going to follow a gamma

14
00:00:50.952 --> 00:00:54.449
distribution with shape a and rate b.

15
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.866
And let's suppose a = 2.

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.200
And b equals 1/3.

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.622
To calculate the mean
of this distribution,

18
00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:08.307
we would need to compute
the following integral.

19
00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:13.156
The expected value of theta
is equal to the integral over

20
00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.540
the whole space for theta.

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.236
Which in the case of a gamma is from 0 to

22
00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:28.011
infinity theta times the density for
theta.

23
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:33.629
Now in the case of a gamma,
this equals the integral

24
00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:38.603
0 to infinity theta times
b to the power of a.

25
00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:42.357
Over a gamma function evaluated at a,

26
00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:47.180
times theta to the a-1,
and e to the -b theta.

27
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.377
This is the integral we
will need to compute.

28
00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:59.791
And in this particular case,
it is possible to compute this integral.

29
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:06.610
The answer is a over b, or with these
particular values the answer is 6.

30
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.919
However, we can verify this answer
using Monte Carlo estimation.

31
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.570
To do so,
we will simulate a large number of draws.

32
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.339
Let's call them theta star i, for

33
00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:25.608
draw i in one up to some large number m.

34
00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:29.377
We would simulate this from
this gamma distribution.

35
00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:31.417
And to estimate the sample,

36
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:36.179
or to estimate the actual theoretical
mean of this distribution.

37
00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.153
We would take the sample mean or
the average of these draws.

38
00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:41.361
Why can we do this?

39
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:46.993
Recall from the previous course that if we
have a random sample from a distribution.

40
00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:51.873
The average of those samples converges
in probability to the true mean of

41
00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:55.076
that distribution by
the Law of Large Numbers.

42
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:58.685
Furthermore, by the central limit theorem,

43
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:03.597
this sample mean or the sample
mean of these pieces right here.

44
00:03:03.597 --> 00:03:07.873
We're going to call that theta bar star,

45
00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:13.715
which is 1/m times the sum
of our simulated values.

46
00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:18.582
Theta star i.

47
00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:25.255
This sample mean right here approximately
follows a normal distribution.

48
00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:30.380
Where the mean of that normal
distribution is the true expected value.

49
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.510
And the variance of that is the true
variance of the distribution divided by m,

50
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.409
the sample size.

51
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.270
The theoretical variance of
theta is the following integral.

52
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.670
The variance of theta just like
the expected value, we did up here.

53
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.170
We're calculating the expected value of
theta minus its expected value squared.

54
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.940
And of course,
multiplying by the density of theta.

55
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.230
Just like we did with the mean,

56
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.750
we could approximate this variance
with the sample variance.

57
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.476
This method of Monte Carlo estimation
can be use to calculate many different

58
00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:18.306
integrals.

59
00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:24.355
Let's say, for example,
that h of theta is function of theta,

60
00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:29.070
and we want to calculate
the following integral.

61
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.893
h of theta times the density of theta,
d theta.

62
00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:40.199
This integral is precisely what is meant

63
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.730
by the expectation of a h of theta.

64
00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:52.132
So, conveniently,
we can approximate it by taking

65
00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:58.010
a sample mean of h evaluated for
each of these samples.

66
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.600
That is if we were to
calculate the sample mean.

67
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.911
Where we evaluate the h function on
each of our simulated samples of theta.

68
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.785
This quantity would approximate this
expected value which is this integral.

69
00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:27.183
So we would apply this function
h to every simulated sample and

70
00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:29.690
then take the average of the results.

71
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.860
One extremely useful example
of such an h function

72
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.479
is the indicator function,
written like this.

73
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:42.690
It's a function of theta and

74
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.270
a here would be some sort of logical
condition about the value of theta.

75
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.694
To demonstrate this let's suppose that

76
00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:58.765
in an example, let's say that h of theta

77
00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:04.296
is the indicator that
theta is less than 5.

78
00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.187
This function here,
this indicator will give us a 1

79
00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:18.748
if theta is indeed less than 5,
or it will return a 0 otherwise.

80
00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:26.940
So what is the expected value,
Of h of theta here?

81
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.980
Well this is the intergral
from zero to infinity,

82
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.980
once again, assuming that theta is
coming from a gamma distribution.

83
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.560
The expected value of h of
theta will be h of theta this

84
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560
indicator function,
times the density of theta.

85
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.220
So if we evaluate this,
this function will come out to be a 1.

86
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.000
If theta is between 0 and 5, so 0 to 5.

87
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.660
1 times the density of theta

88
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.710
plus the rest of the values 5 up to
infinity of 0 times the density.

89
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.982
This piece right here
is going to disappear.

90
00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:26.084
And this right here, if we integrate
the density between these two values.

91
00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:32.373
That's simply calculating the probability
that 0 is less than theta is less than 5.

92
00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:36.210
The probability that theta is
between these two numbers.

93
00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:39.421
So what does this mean?

94
00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:44.334
It means that we can approximate
this probability right

95
00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:48.313
here by drawing many samples,
theta star I.

96
00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:52.254
And approximating this
integral with the following.

97
00:07:54.668 --> 00:08:01.374
We would take the sample mean, Of

98
00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:07.950
these indicator functions where
theta star is less than 5.

99
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.690
And apply it to our simulated values.

100
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.050
What this function does is simply counts

101
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.840
how many of our simulated
values meet this criteria.

102
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.480
And then divides by the total
number of samples taken.

103
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.640
So this approximates the probability
that theta is less than five,

104
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.680
that's pretty convenient.

105
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.640
Likewise, we can approximate
quantiles of a distribution.

106
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.022
If we're looking for
a value z, that makes it so

107
00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:43.601
that the probability of being
less than z is 0.9 for example.

108
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:49.025
We would simply arrange the samples
theta star I in ascending order.

109
00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:53.967
And then we would find the smallest value
of the theta stars that's greater than

110
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.377
90% of the others.

111
00:08:55.377 --> 00:09:00.230
In other words we would take
the 90th percentile of the theta

112
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:05.282
stars to approximate the 0.9
quantile of the distribution.

113
00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:11.709
