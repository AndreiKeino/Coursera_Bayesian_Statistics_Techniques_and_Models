2
00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:07.170
What are the objectives
of statistical models?

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.600
What can they accomplish and where do they
fit in the broader field of data science?

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.970
Statistics is concerned with
the entire process of planning,

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.280
collecting and analyzing data to draw
scientifically defensible conclusions.

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.330
Because these objectives are important
to a wide variety of disciplines,

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.100
you might encounter statistics in areas
ranging from business to medicine,

8
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.950
biology to sports,
social sciences to pharmacology.

9
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.680
Or agriculture to ecology.

10
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.250
This course is about statistical modelling

11
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.181
which falls under
the analyzing data objective.

12
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.270
So what is a statistical model?

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
In this course,
we're going to define a statistical model.

14
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.721
A statistical model will be
a mathematical structure used

15
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:15.013
to imitate, And approximate,

16
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.857
The data generating process.

17
00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.956
It typically describes relationships
among variables while accounting for

18
00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:42.790
uncertainty and variability in the data.

19
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.730
For example, let's consider an experiment
where we wish to reveal a cause and

20
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.760
effect relationship.

21
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.092
If the relationships between variables
are complicated or involve variables

22
00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:02.358
that we can't measure, the data we collect
may appear to have random behavior.

23
00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:07.067
We can account for
this apparent randomness or uncertainty or

24
00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:10.698
variability using
the theory of probability.

25
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:15.445
Then, hopefully a statistical model
will help us identify structural,

26
00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:19.820
such as cause and effect,
relationships hidden in the noisy data.

27
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.140
As an example of another source of
uncertainty and variability in your data,

28
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.996
let's consider a poll conducted
on a sample of likely voters.

29
00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:40.040
Let's say that 57% of those polled are in
favor of one particular candidate.

30
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.580
When presented with these results,
it might be natural to ask,

31
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.220
how confident am I in this 57% number?

32
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.118
Does it mean that 57% of all
people favor that candidate?

33
00:02:55.118 --> 00:03:00.059
Well that depends on several other
questions related to how well the poll

34
00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.010
was conducted for example.

35
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.430
How were the participants selected?

36
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.760
How many people were polled?

37
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.400
If we repeated the poll on another
randomly selected sample of voters,

38
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.639
how might that 57% number change?

39
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.570
Using probability theory,
we can account for

40
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.390
the uncertainty surrounding this estimate.

41
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.940
For what kinds of problems might
we use a statistical model?

42
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.140
Here are four common objectives.

43
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.996
The first one we're going to talk
about is to quantify uncertainty.

44
00:03:45.217 --> 00:03:50.125
In the polling example, we could
come up with a range of reasonable

45
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.731
estimates to put that
57% number in context.

46
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.495
Suppose a statistician
analyzes the poll data and

47
00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:04.986
concludes that with 99% confidence,
the true percentage

48
00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:11.018
of all citizens who favor
the candidate is between 51 and 63%.

49
00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.020
That's a little more informative.

50
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.190
It gives us an idea of how much
we can trust this estimate.

51
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.530
The second objective we'll
talk about is inference.

52
00:04:27.748 --> 00:04:29.450
In the polling example,

53
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.660
we only know a percentage of people in
the sample who support the candidate.

54
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.675
A statistical model helps
us extend the result and

55
00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:43.190
infer what percentage of the total
population supports the candidate?

56
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.120
We may also have other demographic
information about each person in the poll.

57
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.410
A statistical model might allow us
to see how these other variables

58
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.890
relate to a person's likelihood
of supporting the candidate.

59
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.537
The next objective is
measuring the evidence in

60
00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:06.848
the data in support or
against a hypothesis.

61
00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:26.071
In the polling example,
suppose an expert hypothesizes

62
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:31.121
that the candidate is more
popular with men than with women.

63
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.640
Luckily we have further
breakdown of the poll results.

64
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.054
Let's suppose that 55% of
women favor the candidate and

65
00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:49.110
59% of men favor the candidate.

66
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.600
Is this strong enough evidence to
support or validate the experts claim?

67
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.950
A statistical model could account for

68
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.850
the uncertainty in these estimates
to help us answer that question.

69
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.331
The fourth and

70
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.310
final modeling objective that we're
going to talk about is prediction.

71
00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:17.655
In the polling example,

72
00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:22.400
suppose we have demographic
information about a particular voter.

73
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.816
But we don't know which
candidate she supports.

74
00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:30.040
We might employ a statistical model
to use what is known about about her

75
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.180
to make an accurate prediction
of her voting selection.

76
00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:39.600
It is clear that statistical modelling
has much to contribute to data science.

77
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.439
Another key player in this
arena is machine learning.

78
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.920
How does that relate to
statistical modeling?

79
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.500
Broadly, machine learning uses algorithms,
some of which are based on or

80
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.200
can be formulated as statistical models,
to produce state of the art prediction.

81
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.850
That is, machine learning specializes
in and excels at this fourth objective.

82
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.520
Often, excellent predictions
come at the cost

83
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.430
of building complicated models
that are difficult to interpret.

84
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.150
For that reason, such algorithms
are frequently referred to as black boxes.

85
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.600
Of course, who would believe a model that
did not produce realistic predictions?

86
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.350
Objective four is almost always
important but doesn't necessarily

87
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.570
answer all of the questions an
investigator might have about their data.

88
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.849
Statistical models strive to balance
the objectives above to answer

89
00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:38.569
the questions at hand.
