2
00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:11.230
Building statistical models is a process,
and each step should be taken carefully.

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.411
Here we outline the general process and
offer some practical advice.

4
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.816
We'll call this the statistical

5
00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:24.572
modeling, Process.

6
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:35.033
The first step in this process
is to understand the problem.

7
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.449
This may seem obvious, but
understanding the problem and

8
00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.910
context is critical to success.

9
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.870
A sophisticated model might be useless
if it is applied inappropriately.

10
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.360
For example, suppose you have revenue
data from several different locations

11
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.110
of a store chain at unknown locations.

12
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.030
It seems reasonable to
average these revenue numbers

13
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.180
as a summary of how the store is doing.

14
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.220
Then suppose you discover that the stores
are located in different countries and

15
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.740
reported revenues in different currencies.

16
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.470
Now that average doesn't seem to
have much meaning unless, of course,

17
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.980
we get the revenue numbers
converted to the same scale.

18
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.314
The second step is to plan and
properly collect relevant data.

19
00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:48.212
There may be multiple quantities that
you could potentially measure to help

20
00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:49.709
answer your question.

21
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.990
In this step,

22
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.200
you decide what information will be
most useful to solving your problem.

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.860
How to collect the data and
how many data points to collect.

24
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.630
The quality of your data collection
plan determines the value of your data.

25
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.980
For example, if you conduct a survey
of peers in your workplace.

26
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.340
Your results would likely not generalize
to all workers in the company,

27
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.110
especially if there
are multiple work sites.

28
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.413
If you want generalizable results,
a better plan would be to select

29
00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:28.726
a random sample among all employees
to participate in your survey.

30
00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:36.411
The step is addressed in detail in
most introductory statistics courses.

31
00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.623
The third step in this process
is to explore your data.

32
00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:54.190
In this step, you should ensure that
the data collection plan was followed.

33
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.270
And that the data were
recorded accurately.

34
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.220
If there are major surprises in that data,
verified that they are not errors.

35
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.530
In this step,
you'll often want to visualize the data to

36
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.030
gain a basic understanding of
the relationships among your variables.

37
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.271
This can help you decide what kinds
of models might be appropriate.

38
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:20.206
Finally, the practice of snooping
around or mining your data,

39
00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:24.903
looking for interesting hypothesis
to test can potentially invalidate

40
00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.350
your statistical modeling results.

41
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.400
If you want to mine your data,
and test your findings,

42
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.520
it is usually best to randomly
split your data into two parts.

43
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.810
With one part, you can look for
interesting things to test and

44
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.180
fit different potential models.

45
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.990
With the other, you can fit the model
you chose using the first part

46
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.290
to validate or see if the results
can be replicated on other data.

47
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.653
The fourth step in this process
is to postulate a model.

48
00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:10.884
After gaining an understanding of how your
data are structured, choose a model that

49
00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:17.150
can appropriately approximate or summarize
the interesting content of the data.

50
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.580
This might be an off the shelf
statistical model like a regression or

51
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.140
it could be based on a scientific
theory such as a growth model.

52
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.690
It could also be multiple models.

53
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.270
Generally, it is desirable to find
a model where the parameters we estimate

54
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.760
can be interpreted in the context
of the original problem.

55
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.090
You might also have to strike a balance
between model complexity, and

56
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.500
model generalizability.

57
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.590
This is often referred to as
the bias variance tradeoff.

58
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.690
Large complex models, might be able to
fit your particular dataset very well.

59
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.440
But may fail to generalize to future data.

60
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.910
Let's look at an example of this.

61
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.600
Let's suppose your data looked like this.

62
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.060
x is your explanatory variable,
y is your response variable.

63
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.060
And you have points like these.

64
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.381
One possible model you could fit would
be just a linear regression going

65
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.760
through the points.

66
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.506
Another possibility for model you
could fit here would be essentially

67
00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:36.251
an interpolator that makes sure it
goes through every single point.

68
00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:42.870
Now, consider a future scenario
where you've got another

69
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.840
dataset just like this one
with a new cloud of points.

70
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.490
You can imagine that perhaps
this interpolated model,

71
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.895
which fit the original dataset perfectly,
might struggle on a future dataset.

72
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.878
The next step in our statistical
modeling process is to fit the model.

73
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.710
In this step we need to estimate the
parameters of the model using the data.

74
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.233
In this particular class, we're going to
take a Bayesian approach to this step.

75
00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:24.376
Next, we're going to check the model.

76
00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.081
Here we want to check to see if
the model adequately imitates the data

77
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.720
generating process.

78
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.730
Are predictions from the model realistic?

79
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.000
Does it fit well to your data?

80
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.310
Or does it completely miss
some of the features?

81
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200
We'll look into some the techniques for

82
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.000
doing this, including residual analysis
and predictive checks later in the course.

83
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.196
In this step,

84
00:06:55.196 --> 00:06:59.509
we may also compare a competing
models according to some criteria.

85
00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:05.129
Next, we're going to iterate.

86
00:07:08.576 --> 00:07:14.130
That is, return, possibly,
to steps 4 through 6.

87
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.727
If the model you have already fit is, for
some reason, inadequate, we should return

88
00:07:19.727 --> 00:07:24.857
to step 4 and proceed through step 6
again with a new, and hopefully better,

89
00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:30.170
model that would address or correct
the deficiencies from your previous model.

90
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.836
Finally, we're going to use the model.

91
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.364
If we've iterated through these enough
times and decided that the model is good,

92
00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:48.198
or that we have selected an appropriate
model, we can use the results to answer

93
00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:52.103
your original research questions and
arrive at conclusions.

94
00:07:54.146 --> 00:07:59.620
In this course, we are going
to focus on steps 4 through 8.

95
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.640
But this does not mean steps 1 through
3 should be ignored in any analysis.

96
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.030
In fact, the importance of steps
1 through 3 cannot be overstated.

97
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.000
The validity of you final
results depends on them.

98
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.890
That is why most introductory statistics
courses will emphasize these steps.

99
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.520
If you'll not explore this issues in
an introductory statistics course,

100
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.240
we highly recommend you do so.

101
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.174
We hope you'll refer to this outline,

102
00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:41.262
the statistical modeling process
often as you begin modeling data.

103
