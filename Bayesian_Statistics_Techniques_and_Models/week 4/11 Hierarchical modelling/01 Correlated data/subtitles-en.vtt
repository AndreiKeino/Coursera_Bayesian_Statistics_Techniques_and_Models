2
00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:06.514
In all of our modelling
throughout the last few lessons,

3
00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:10.280
we have assumed that all
the observations were independent.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.360
Sometimes, that's obviously
not true about our data.

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.370
There is often a natural grouping to our
data points which leads us to believe that

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.090
some observation pairs should be more
similar to each other than to others.

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.310
Let's look at an example.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.670
In the previous course,
we talked about using a Poisson model for

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.880
counting chocolate chips in cookies.

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.730
Let's suppose that you own a company
that produces chocolate chip cookies.

11
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.903
In an experiment,
you're going to produce 150 test cookies.

12
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.236
Let's say you'll do 30
from your location and

13
00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:58.180
then 30 from four other factory locations.

14
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.111
So let's write this as 30
from each of 5 locations.

15
00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:16.273
We're going to assume that all the
locations use the same recipe when they

16
00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:18.340
make their chocolate chip cookies.

17
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.410
So now, would you expect
a cookie from your location,

18
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.940
location one, to be more similar
to another cookie from your batch

19
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.420
than to a cookie from another
locations' batch, I'd say probably.

20
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.240
There's a natural grouping to the cookies.

21
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.050
We can account for the likely differences
between cookies in your Poisson model

22
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.940
by making it a hierarchical model.

23
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.515
The original fully independent mode for
model for

24
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:54.180
Poisson, the number of chips in
the cookies would have looked like this.

25
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.323
Let's call this the fully
independent model.

26
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:08.159
For cookie i the number of chips,
given lambda,

27
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:15.799
the mean would be iid from a Poisson
distribution with mean lambda.

28
00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.534
For i = 1 up to n which
in our case is a 150.

29
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.326
One way we can acknowledge the grouping
in the counts is to assign

30
00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:33.980
a different lambda parameter for
each location.

31
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.098
So, we're going to do
a location dependent model.

32
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.607
We'll say that the ith cookie which
happens to be in the lth location

33
00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:56.870
follows a Poisson with a mean lambda that
depends on the location of cookie i.

34
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.950
So that is, yi given the location
of where cookie i was made.

35
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.333
And lambda li will come independently

36
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:16.321
from a Poisson lambda li,

37
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:22.485
where li can take on values between 1 and

38
00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:27.562
5 because there are five locations,

39
00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:31.210
and i = 1 up to 150.

40
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.035
That is,
if cookie i comes from location two,

41
00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:39.265
for example then li will be 2.

42
00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:43.998
And so the expected number of chips
in cookie i will be lambda 2.

43
00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:49.510
So far,
this looks like a one way ANOVA model.

44
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.210
What make this a hierarchical model

45
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.410
is that instead of placing
an independent prior for

46
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.310
each of the lambda parameters, we're going
to assume that they come from a common

47
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.510
distribution with hyper parameters
that we're going to estimate as well.

48
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.820
That is, we're going to say that lambda l,
given our hyper parameters,

49
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.580
alpha and beta, will be iid from a gamma

50
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.640
distribution with shape alpha and
rate beta.

51
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.265
This is for location 1 up to location 5.

52
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.699
We'll complete this model with priors for
alpha and beta.

53
00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.907
So we'll say,
alpha comes from the prior for alpha.

54
00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:41.255
Beta comes from the prior distribution for
beta.

55
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.800
It's also useful to see the graphical
representation of this model.

56
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.314
We're going to start at the top of
the hierarchy with the parameters

57
00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:53.950
that are independent.

58
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.395
So we have a note for
alpha and a note for beta.

59
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.610
And depended on these two parameters,
we have all of the lambdas.

60
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.079
So, lambda 1, lambda 2, up to lambda 5.

61
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:13.371
And of course the distribution for

62
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:20.031
each of these lambdas depends
on both alpha and beta.

63
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.002
In the next level down,

64
00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:30.887
we have all of the cookies
that are from location 1.

65
00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:34.881
So I'm going to say, yi for

66
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:40.630
i such that location of i is equal to 1.

67
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.672
So these are all the cookies
from location 1.

68
00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:50.233
We can do the same thing for
all of the other batches,

69
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:56.050
i such that the location
that i is equal to 2 and

70
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.247
a plate for this group over here,

71
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.647
Such that location i = 5.

72
00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.800
The lowest level here represents
each individual cookie.

73
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.040
And cookies are grouped by location, which
is represented here at the second level.

74
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.460
For each location, we have a parameter for
the mean number of chocolate chips.

75
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.400
These five means come from a common
distribution, who's parameters we can

76
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.670
also estimate, because the five lambdas
can be thought of as data at this level.

77
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.290
If we hadn't used the hierarchical model
for the cookie example here, two obvious

78
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:52.190
modeling choices would have been to first,
fit a single model to all of the data,

79
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.420
treating all 150 cookies as though they're
independent like we did here in number 1.

80
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.805
Or second, fit five separate Poisson
models, one for each location.

81
00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:06.974
The book Bayesian Data Analysis
by Galman and co-authors,

82
00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:11.305
which is listed as one of your
references for further reading,

83
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:15.718
describes the trade offs,
between these types of options, and

84
00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:19.420
how hierarchical models
provide a good compromise.

85
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.940
For example, if we had fit the original
model with 150 independent cookies,

86
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.870
we would be ignoring potential differences
between locations and the fact

87
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.540
that cookies from the same location are
likely to be more similar to each other.

88
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.050
On the other hand, if we had fit five
separate Poisson models, one for

89
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.430
each batch of cookies, we would
potentially be ignoring information that

90
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.050
could help us estimate the lambda
parameter for your location.

91
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.330
Because separate models would
ignore data from other locations.

92
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.900
Since all locations use the same recipe,

93
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.500
it seems reasonable that information
about another location's cookies

94
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.660
might provide information about
your cookies, at least indirectly.

95
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.050
In this sense,
hierarchical models share information,

96
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.350
or borrow strength, from all the data.

97
00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:22.480
That is, your lambda is not only estimated
directly from your 30 cookies, but

98
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.397
also indirectly from the other 120 cookies
leveraging this hierarchical structure.

99
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.391
Being able to account for relationships
in the data while estimating everything

100
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:40.063
with the single model is a primary
advantage of using hierarchical models.

101
