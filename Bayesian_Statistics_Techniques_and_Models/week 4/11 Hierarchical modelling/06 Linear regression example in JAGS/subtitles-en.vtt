00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.150
Let's see if we can improve on our
analysis of the Leinhardt data

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.780
by extending our linear model

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.690
on infant mortality to
incorporate the region variable.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.220
We will do this with a hierarchical model
where each region has its own intercept.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.380
First we need to read in the car
library and the Leinhardt dataset.

6
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.160
Let's reacquaint ourselves
with the dataset really fast.

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.670
We have a number of countries,
we have per capita income for

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.350
each country standardized.

9
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.040
Infant mortality in that country,
region, and

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
then indicator of whether
that country exports oil.

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.770
The log of infant mortality
is our response variable.

12
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.240
And previously, the log of income and

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.990
the oil indicator were used as
covariants in the linear model.

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
Remember also that we had missing values
in the data set which we will remove and

15
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.710
we also need to calculate the log
transformations for income and

16
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.740
infant mortality.

17
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.720
And just to verify, let's look
at the structure of the dataset.

18
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.300
We still have income infant mortality,
region,

19
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.890
oil, and now, the log of income and
the log of infant mortality.

20
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.570
We've dropped down to 101 observations.

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.920
Now let's talk about the model string for
this hierarchical model.

22
00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:43.437
In the likelihood portion, of course,

23
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.020
we have the loop looping
over all of the data points.

24
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.230
The ith response which is log of
infant mortality comes from a normal

25
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.020
distribution with mu sub i and we have

26
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.010
the linear portion of the model connected
to the mean of that normal likelihood.

27
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.800
Previously, we had an intercept
here as well as these two terms.

28
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.700
The modification we're making for
this hierarchical model is similar to what

29
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.990
we did with the lambdas in the chocolate
chip cookie hierarchical model.

30
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.650
Each region now gets its own intercept.

31
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.710
So for example if the 50th
country is from region 3,

32
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.110
the model will fit mu 3 using intercept 3.

33
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.750
This is a nested index.

34
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.560
Each of these intercepts will come
from the same normal distribution.

35
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.490
So we will loop over j from 1 to
the maximum number of regions,

36
00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.018
and each of these intercepts comes from
a normal distribution with mean a0 and

37
00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:04.060
precision prec_a.

38
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.940
Of course, for the next level in the
hierarchy we need to produce priors for

39
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.480
a0 and prec_a.

40
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.610
The mean of this distribution
represents the mean of all intersects.

41
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.519
And the precision is related to
the variance of these intersects.

42
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.800
We'll use fairly standard priors here.

43
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.400
We'll use a normal distribution
centered on 0 for a0.

44
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.200
And we'll use an inverse gamma prior on
the variance of that normal distribution,

45
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.720
which implies a gamma
prior on the precision.

46
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.360
Rather than monitor the precision,
we're going to monitor tou,

47
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.570
which will be the standard deviation
of this normal distribution.

48
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.810
The remaining lines are the same as
they were for the linear model before.

49
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.610
We need to provide priors for

50
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.680
each of the coefficients in
the linear part of the model and

51
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.140
of course we need to produce a prior for
the precision in the likelihood.

52
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.150
Let's go ahead and
load in all of these pieces here and

53
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.360
set the seed and run the data.

54
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.540
This should look just like we had
before except we're now adding

55
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.188
a numeric variable which
indicates the region.

56
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:35.470
Previously that $region
was a factor variable.

57
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.040
We're turning into a numeric variable.

58
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.750
If I run just this piece you can
see that there are four regions.

59
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.369
As we move through the data set
the index of the region changes.

60
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.250
Don't forget also that the is_oil
was changed to be 0s and

61
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.350
1s, indicating whether
the country exports oil.

62
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.270
One other important thing to
check is whether all of the oil

63
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.890
exporting countries
are within a single region.

64
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.705
If that were the case,
our model could potentially suffer from

65
00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:15.580
confounding because we wouldn't know
whether it's the oil variable or

66
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.580
the region variable that's affecting,
that is potentially explaining some of

67
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.280
the variability in infant mortality.

68
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.840
It looks like this is not the case.

69
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.060
This row represents the oil
exporting countries.

70
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.760
The only region not
represented is region 4.

71
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.730
We're going to monitor
all of these parameters,

72
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.980
including the hierarchical parameters for
the intercepts a_zero, and tou.

73
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.670
Let's go ahead and
initialize the model, update the model,

74
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.020
run a burn-in period, and
we'll collect our posterior samples.

75
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.400
We won't go through all of the steps here,
but

76
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.910
it's always important to check
your convergence diagnostics.

77
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.979
Let's take a look at
the trace plots really fast.

78
00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.439
We need to add ask=TRUE to this line.

79
00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:17.810
These trace plots don't look green.

80
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.010
They appear to be highly auto correlated.

81
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.840
And so if you wanted to create posterior
probability intervals as part of

82
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.620
your inferences from this model, it would
be a good idea to run these chains for

83
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.750
many more iterations.

84
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.930
Let's look at the next set.

85
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.190
We have some pretty high auto correlation
within these different chains for

86
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.620
the first beta coefficient.

87
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.670
The other beta coefficient looks
just fine as well as the trace for

88
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.660
the standard deviation of the likelihood.

89
00:06:55.705 --> 00:07:01.718
This trace plot also looks pretty good.

90
00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:07.743
Next, let's compare this model with the
old linear model from before using DIC,

91
00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.200
we'll run the DIC samples here.

92
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.260
We get about 221.

93
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.462
Remember, the previous
linear model that we fit,

94
00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:24.770
including the is_oil covariate,
had a DIC value of about 229.

95
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.660
So it appears that this
model is an improvement

96
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.280
over the non hierarchical one fit earlier.

97
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.350
Notice also that the penalty term
which is interpreted as the effective

98
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.860
number of parameters is less than the
actual number of parameters in this model.

99
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.310
We have nine parameters.

100
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.370
We have fewer effective parameters in this
model because they are sharing information

101
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.580
or borrowing strength from each
other in a hierarchical structure.

102
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.700
If we had skipped the hierarchy and
fit only one intercept,

103
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.750
there would have been four
parameters in this model.

104
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.030
If we had fit separate
independent intercepts for

105
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.610
each region,
there would have been seven parameters.

106
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.450
This is actually pretty close
to what we ended up with.

107
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.180
Finally, let's look at our posterior
summary of our inferences from this model.

108
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:29.740
Here are our posterior means for the four
linear intercepts one for each region.

109
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.250
The overall mean for those intercepts,
the standard deviation of the intercepts,

110
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.576
that is how the intercepts from each
region differ from one another,

111
00:08:40.576 --> 00:08:45.730
are coefficient for income and

112
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.500
our coefficient for
oil exporting countries.

113
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.170
Each of these coefficients
is smaller in magnitude

114
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.610
than it was in the previous model,

115
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.760
possibly because the region variable is
now explaining some of the variability.

116
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.400
However, the signs of these coefficients
remain the same as they were before.

117
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.030
In this particular model, the intercepts
do not have a real interpretation

118
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.640
because they correspond to the mean
response for a country that does not

119
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.290
produce oil and
has $0 of log income per capita.

120
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.950
In other words that would be $1 of income
per capita, which is not the case for

121
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.710
these countries.

122
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.800
In this example we have not
investigated adding interaction terms,

123
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.670
which might be appropriate.

124
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.930
We only considered adding
hierarchy on the intercepts.

125
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.790
But in reality nothing prevents
us from doing the same for

126
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:51.440
other terms in the model, such as
the coefficients for income and oil.

127
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.660
We could try any or
all of these alternatives and

128
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.489
see how the DIC changes for these models.

129
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.380
This, together with other
model checking techniques,

130
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.940
including residual checks that
we've discussed, could be used to

131
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.990
identify our best model that you could
use to make inferences and predictions.
