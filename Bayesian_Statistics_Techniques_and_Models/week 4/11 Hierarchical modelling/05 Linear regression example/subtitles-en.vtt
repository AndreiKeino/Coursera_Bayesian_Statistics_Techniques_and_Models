2
00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:07.653
Let's now look at how we might use
hierarchical modeling to extend a linear

3
00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:08.198
model.

4
00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:18.929
Recall that our linear model for
infant mortality looked like this.

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.490
Response yi given
the explanatory variables for

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.130
country i, the beta coefficients and

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
the variants came
independently from a normal

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.640
distribution with mean beta
naught plus beta 1 times x1i

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.270
plus beta 2 times x2i and
variance sigma squared,

10
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.150
for country i in 1 up to n.

11
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.350
Here, yi is the log of infant
mortality for country i.

12
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.860
x1i is the log of per capita income for
country i.

13
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.810
And x2i is an indicator that
the country exports oil.

14
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.180
We haven't yet incorporated information
about where the country is located,

15
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.459
which may also help explain some of
the variability in infant mortality.

16
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.650
There's another variable in
the data set called region.

17
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.890
And it seems reasonable that countries in
the same region may be correlated with

18
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.530
one another rather than independent which
is what the current linear model assumes.

19
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.451
One way we can do this is
through the intercept.

20
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:44.895
We're going to use what's called
a random intercept model.

21
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.319
Rather than place a standard
prior on beta naught e intercept,

22
00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.690
we can let each region
have its own intercept.

23
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.210
And then the group of intercepts will
come from a common distribution.

24
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.400
So, to illustrate, we're going to
change the name of beta naught,

25
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.800
the intercept, to alpha.

26
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.226
We'll write the model like this,
yi given the region of country I,

27
00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:20.512
as well as the other
explanatory variables,

28
00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:26.624
the alpha parameters,
the beta parameters and sigma squared.

29
00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:32.760
In fact we only need to condition on the
one alpha that corresponds to country i.

30
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.510
But given all of these,
yi is independent normal

31
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.070
with mean alpha sub ri

32
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.960
plus beta 1x1i plus beta

33
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.350
2x2i, variance sigma squared.

34
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.250
Now, the r sub Is will be one of

35
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.300
the numbers one up to capital R,
the number of regions.

36
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.677
And as usual, I will go from 1 up to n.

37
00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:15.730
Here alpha is indexed by R.

38
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.960
Which is a number that indicates
which region country i is in.

39
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.500
So for example if country i is in
region four, then our sub i will be

40
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.981
equal to 4 and the intercept for
y sub i will be alpha sub 4.

41
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.163
In the next level,
we have the alpha sub r,

42
00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:43.470
given hyper parameters Mu and Tau squared,

43
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.061
will be iid from a normal distribution

44
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:52.806
with mean Mu and variance Tau squared.

45
00:03:55.364 --> 00:04:01.030
This will be for region 1 up to capital R.

46
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.500
To complete the hierarchical model,
we need prior distributions also for

47
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.260
the betas, for sigma squared,
for Mu, and for Tau squared.

48
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.890
Mu represents the mean of
the intercepts across all regions and

49
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.631
tau squared represents the variability
of the intercepts across regions.

50
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.320
How much they differ from
one region to the next.

51
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.880
In addition to inducing correlation and

52
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.960
why among the countries
in the same region.

53
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.060
These parameters can be estimated
from their posterior distributions.

54
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.510
They may be interesting
to researchers above and

55
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.380
beyond just the beta
coefficient parameters.

56
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.790
The graphical model representation
of this hierarchical model

57
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.420
could be written like this.

58
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.564
At the top level we have Mu and
Tau squared and

59
00:05:00.564 --> 00:05:05.291
for simplicity, I'm going to write all

60
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.339
of the alphas on a plate together.

61
00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:14.170
So this is alpha r for
rn1 up to capital R.

62
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.660
The alphas depend on Mu and Tau squared.

63
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.761
And at the same level as the Taus, or, I'm
sorry, at the same level as the alphas,

64
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:31.647
we have parameter beta 1,
beta 2, and sigma squared.

65
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.718
Underneath these, we have the plate for

66
00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:47.243
the data, so we have y sub i,
which is observed.

67
00:05:47.243 --> 00:05:51.062
Then we have the region for country i and

68
00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:56.503
I'm going to make this a square
because it's not random,

69
00:05:56.503 --> 00:06:02.436
we don't place a prior distribution
on r or either of the xs.

70
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.089
So I'll put double squares on those.

71
00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:19.668
And this is for country i and 1 up to n.

72
00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:26.316
Now, the yis depend on all
of the observed covariants,

73
00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:32.268
as well as on alphas,
betas, and sigma squared.

74
00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:36.152
In this drawing,

75
00:06:36.152 --> 00:06:42.220
it would be more correct to draw
the alpha sub r parameter separately.

76
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.230
Each affecting their own
respective set of yi variables.

77
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.840
Here we drew arrows from all
the the alphas affecting yi, but

78
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.950
of course only one of them actually does.

79
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.120
This drawing at least helps us to
visualize the levels of the hierarchy.

80
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.140
We could easily envision
other hierarchical models,

81
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.150
such as ones that place hierarchy
on the beta coefficients.

82
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:16.410
For example, if we use the region
variable to index beta 1 as we did with

83
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.500
the intercepts, this will indicate
our belief that the coefficient or

84
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.940
the effect of income on infant
mortality is different for each region.

85
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.860
But these effects are related and
come from a common distribution.

86
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.916
For now, we're going to focus on
the random intercept only model.

87
00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:41.639
